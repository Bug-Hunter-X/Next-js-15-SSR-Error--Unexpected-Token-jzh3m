# Next.js 15 SSR Error: Unexpected Token

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications when using server-side rendering (SSR).  The error, often manifesting as an "Unexpected token" or similar syntax error, can occur during the build process or at runtime.

The issue is usually related to incorrect or improperly handled data within `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, or API routes.  Improper error handling or attempting to return invalid data can trigger this unexpected token error.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.

**Solution:**

Refer to `bugSolution.js` for a possible solution involving robust error handling within `getServerSideProps` and ensuring that only valid JSON or other correctly structured data is returned.  The key is to properly handle potential exceptions and ensure consistent data formatting before passing data to the frontend.
